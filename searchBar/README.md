search bar

1. search data based on query from the API (use debouncing) --- API response is already filtered. Other thing that we can do is get the list of all countries one time and then filter the countries using "includes"

2. render the results in a list

3. on click of any search item inside the list, close the list and put the selected item into the search bar (use event delegation)
